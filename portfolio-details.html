              <h3>Principles of Operation</h3>
               <!-- <ul>
                How does an RC circuit respond to a voltage step? We solve for the total response as the sum of 
                the forced and natural response. The RC step response is a fundamental behavior of all digital circuits
              </ul> -->
              <ul>
                Universal testing systems with open-loop and closed-loop systems both work with a controller that operates the machine’s movement. The controller sends information to the motor (e.g. to move the machine at 20mm per min). Once the input passes into 
                the start of the system and produces the output, the motor initiates the movement of the crosshead or the ram accordingly.

              <h2>What are open and Closed loop systems ?</h2>
              <p>
                The main difference between an open-loop system and a closed-loop system is that 
                the closed-loop system has the ability to self-correct while the open-loop system doesn’t. Consequently, closed-loop systems are often
                 called feedback control systems while open-loop systems are also known as non-feedback controls.

            <h3>Open Loop Systems</h3>
            <p>
              Open-loop systems tend to be simple and inexpensive as they do not provide feedback from the machine movement to the controller. 
              In other words, open-loop systems act solely on the basis of the input and do not use 
              feedback from the output to self-correct while the test is running. 
              Thus, the test procedure entered into an open-loop controller may vary due to external disturbances,
               like noise, without the operator noticing. The data acquired from a universal testing machine with an open-loop controller may be imprecise.</br>

              In materials testing, when running systems with an open-loop controller, keeping the speed constant might become a problem as there is no direct feedback to monitor and regulate control.  The speed of the machine might change during a test due to various reasons, and the open loop system does not have a feedback control to let the controller know of these changes. The test will run at a modified speed without the machine or the operator noticing. This is a problem especially if tests are to be run per ASTM standards or in any test where the speed has to be kept constant.
             <h3> Examples</h3>
             <p>Open Loop Control System
              In open loop control system, the output does not affect the control action of the system. 
              In other words, the system whose working depends on time is known as the open loop control system. The open loop system is free from the feedback. 
              Let’s understand this with the help of the few examples.<br>
              <strong>Example 1:</strong> Consider the clothes dryer whose control action is done manually by the operator. 
              Depending on the wetness of the clothes suppose the operator set the timer for 30 minutes.
               After 30 minutes the timer will stop even after the clothes are wet.<br>
               The dryer stops working even if the desired output is not obtained. This shows that the system has no feedback. Here clothes dryer is the example of the open loop system and the timer is the controller of the system.<br><br>
              <strong> Example 2: </strong>The automatic washing machine is the example of the open loop system. 
               The operator manually sets the operating time of the machine. 
               The machine stops operating after the set time, even the desire cleanliness of clothes are not obtained. 
               This happens because the machine has no feedback system which signals the control action of the system for
                desired output.<br><br>

               The open loop system is simple, require less maintenance. 
               Also, it is fast in operation and very economical. 
               But the accuracy of the system is less, and it is less reliable.
            </p>
            </p>
            <h3>Closed Loop Systems</h3>
            <p>Universal testing machines with closed-loop control 
              systems have a feedback loop that continuously sends 
              information from the closed-loop controller to the motor 
              and also from the motor to the closed-loop controller. This constant feedback allows
               certain variables such as the load rate and the stress rate to remain as specified throughout the 
               tests. Closed-loop systems provide
               higher accuracy due to the ability to react immediately to possible changes.<br>
              
               <p>The closed-loop control system means the output of the system depends on their input. 
                The system has one or more feedback loops between its output and input. The closed-loop system design in such a way that they automatically provide the desired output by comparing it with the actual input. 
                The closed-loop system generates the error signal which is the difference between the input and output.<br><br>
                <h3> Examples</h3>
               <strong >Example 1:</strong> Suppose in the closed dryer we are using the transducer which senses the dryness of the clothes and provides the feedback signal to the controller relating to dryness. Here the dryness is the output of the system. The sensor act as a feedback of the system. 
                The sensor gives the signal to the controller of the machine, and hence the dryer provides the desired output.<br><br>

<strong>Example 2: </strong>The air conditioner is the example of the closed-loop system. The air conditioner regulates the temperature by comparing it with the surrounding temperature. The comparison of temperature is done with the help of the thermostat. When the AC provides the error signal which is the difference between the surrounding temperature and room temperature the thermostats turn on or off the compressor.<br><br>

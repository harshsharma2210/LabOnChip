              <h3>Matematical Modelling </h3>
              <ul>
                To make progress on the control system design problem, it is first necessary to gain an understanding of how the process operates.  This understanding is typically expressed in the form of a mathematical model.

                The power of a mathematical model lies in the fact that it can be simulated in hypothetical situations, be  subject to states that would be dangerous in reality,  and it can be used as a basis for synthesizing controllers.

          <h1> what are Dynamics & Control</h1><br>
          <p>
            The purpose of dynamics is to study how time and force act on a mechanism, while the purpose of controls is to study how a system should respond to errors and disturbances. At this point, we have described how to reason about the positions of robots and how to generate continuous paths. But actually executing those paths requires us to think much more carefully about the physics of robot mechanisms, and the role of time and velocity. Even the strongest robots cannot instantaneously change velocities, and driving and flying robots cannot move sideways.

It is through the use of control that an industrial robot can move to a position with sub-millimeter accuracy, and an aircraft can fly for thousands of kilometers but land on an airstrip a few meters wide. It is also a means for understanding locomotion and reflexes in the biological sensorimotor system. It is important to note that both dynamics and control are deep fields of study that are more than one hundred years old, and yet they are still undergoing significant change! Classical approaches rely heavily on mathematical analysis, while more modern approaches to control rely on computation as a key tool. Due to this depth, to master these fields requires years of specialized investigation, and this part of the book can only survey the main points as they relate to robotics. We will see some of both the historical and modern approaches in the next few chapters.

In the topic of dynamics we will cover 1) basic terminology of dynamical systems, 2) simple dynamical systems from physics, 3) the dynamics of articulated robots, and 4) contact mechanics. In controls will describe methods for 1) analyzing stability of controlled dynamical systems, 2) controlling articulated robots with high accuracy, and 3) generating feasible and optimal control strategies.

         <h1>  MAX6675 K-Thermocouple IC Working </h1></br>
         <p>
          The function of the thermocouple is to sense a difference in 
          temperature between two ends of the thermocouple wires.
           The thermocouple’s hot junction can be read from 0°C to +1023.75°C.
            The cold end (ambient temperature of the board on which the MAX6675 is mounted)
             can only range from -20°C to +85°C. While the temperature at the cold end fluctuates, the MAX6675 continues to accurately sense the temperature difference at the opposite end. The MAX6675 senses and corrects for the changes in the ambient temperature with cold-junction compensation. The device converts the ambient temperature reading into a voltage using a temperature-sensing diode. To make the actual thermocouple temperature measurement, the MAX6675 measures the voltage from the thermocouple’s output and the sensing diode. The device’s internal circuitry passes the diode’s voltage (sensing ambient temperature) and thermocouple voltage (sensing remote temperature minus ambient temperature) to the conversion function stored in the ADC to calculate the thermocouple’s hot-junction temperature. Optimal performance from the MAX6675 is achieved when the thermocouple cold junction and the MAX6675 are at the same temperature. The MAX6675 includes signal-conditioning hardware to convert the thermocouple’s signal into a voltage compatible with the input channels of the ADC. The T+ and T inputs connect 
          to internal circuitry that reduces the introduction of noise errors from the thermocouple wires.
         </p>
         <h1>Components Required to build a PID Enabled Temperature Controller</h1><br>
         The components required to build the MAX6675 based PID Controlled Heater are listed below, we designed this circuit with very generic components, which makes the replication process very easy.

        <li> Arduino Nano - 1
         <li>128 X 64 OLED Display - 1
        <li> Generic Rotary Encoder - 1
        <li> MAX6675 Module - 1
        <li> K-type Thermocouple - 1
        <li> Breadboard - 1
        <li> Jumper Wires - 1</li></br>
          <h1>Setting of the Temperature</h1></br>
<p> A rotary encoder is utilized to specify the set point temperature. The rotary encoder works in two 
  modes, temperature setting mode and feedback measuring mode. The temperature setting mode will 
  be used to set the temperature by increasing or decreasing the data based on the user’s input and the 
  feedback measuring mode is used to display the feedback value obtained from K-type 
  thermocouple. The temperature can also be set by the interface provided by the website.</p>
  <h1>Setting and maintaining of Temperature</h1></br>
<p>The system consists of a K-type thermocouple and an analog to digital converter, namely MAX6675 
  IC. It can record temperature changes in the hundreds of degrees Celsius range without trouble. The 
  thermocouple’s hot junction can be read from 0°C to 1022°C.<br><br>
  The MAX6675 K-type Thermocouple functions as an analog-to-digital converter module and is used 
to read thermocouple temperature data. The thermocouple monitors temperature differences between 
the two ends of the thermocouple wires. As described above in section 3.3, a generic rotary encoder 
is used to regulate the temperature and adjust the modes. Since this fixed temperature was previously 
determined and the desired temperature requires a real-time display of the temperature data, a 128x64 
OLED display was chosen. The display shows the temperature data as well as the temperature that 
has been set.
  </p>
  <h1>Mathematical Analysis and Calculations</h1>
  <p>The combination of proportional, integral, and derivative control operations is called PID control 
    operation. The PID controller is commonly used to control the time domain behaviour of many 
    different types of dynamic plants. These regulators are usually very popular because they provide 
    excellent closed-loop response characteristics.<br><br>
    Consider the feedback system architecture shown in the given figure. In this architecture, it can be 
    assumed that the equipment is a DC motor and its speed needs to be precisely controlled.
    The PID controller is placed in the forward path so that its output is the voltage applied to the 
    armature of the motor, and the feedback signal is the speed measured by the Photoelectric speed 
    sensor encoder. The output velocity signal C (t) is summed with the reference signal or command 
    signal R (t) to form the error signal e (t). Finally, the error signal is the input to the PID controller<br><br>
    u(t)=Kp.e(t) + Ki ∫e(t) +Kd. d e(t)/ dt(t) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - eqn. (1)</p>
    <h1>Result & Conclusion</h1>
    <p>  The Rotary encoder in 2nd mode will set the temperature to a desired value. Once the 
      controller detects the set value, the feedback from MAX6675 module will provide the current value 
      of temperature to OLED display as shown in figure.<br><br>
     In this experiment, we have been able to produce the feedback from the MAX6675 module, which is 
      connected to any desired system for temperature measurement. The current value of temperature is 
      getting closer to the set value in a certain time. </p>

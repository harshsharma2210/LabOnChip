          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
          Practical experimentation is essential for electronics learning. </br>
          As the acquisition of practical and professional competences in a full online scenario is concerned, it is very relevant the use of technology that allows students
           to carry out hands-on experiments. An innovative laboratory methodology 
           “Hands on virtual laboratory for control systems” that is an introductory course on control systems is presented. Instead of having traditional lab experiences, where students have to come to school classrooms, a “lab at home” concept is proposed.
Students perform real experiments in their own homes, using hardware kits specially developed for this purpose. They analyze given problems, design the appropriate solutions, and test the actual circuit in a distance learning context.
The virtual laboratory features lecture notes and other computer simulations to improve learning incorporating hands-on laboratory experience at home at the same time. The “virtual laboratory” is shown to be very suitable for high enrollment courses and easy to scale, providing actual hardware platforms for
 students at an affordable cost for the institution.<br><br>
 New advancements have changed the world since the end of the twentieth century, speeding up the extreme change in the public eye and the economy, which these initial twenty years of the 21st century have distinguished. An illustration of this change is the many 
 errands that were performed physically in the past that have been mechanized lately. 
 What's more, subsequently, the work scene of the present society has been significantly adjusted. 
 One more illustration of how new advances have separated the present society 
 from that of the twentieth century is in the situation that began from the COVID-19 pandemic.<br>
 
 For sure, since the pandemic was pronounced, the utilization of new advancements has permitted an
  enormous piece of the financial areas to proceed with their movement in a moderately ordinary and safe manner, because of remote work. Right now, the majority of society utilizes data and correspondence innovations, information and communication technologies (ICT) day by day, making a better approach for life and social conduct.<br><br>

 Hence, most distant individual correspondences are brought out through texting administrations, which is a change from what happened only 30 years prior when the most widely recognized specialized strategy was called. Similarly, 
 electronic mail has totally supplanted postal mail (both in the individual circle and between establishments or organizations); the creation and 
 sharing of pictures and recordings have uprooted a significant part of the data that was once 
 shared through text; informal communities have made another idea of the connection between individuals from
  everywhere the world; and so on Such is the impact of ICTs on society that two new descriptive words arise to 
  characterize individuals: (i) advanced locals, who are those people who were brought into the world with the ICT
   upheaval previously merged; and (ii) computerized settlers, who are the individuals who were brought into
    the world before the ICT upset started, and from a specific point in their life have needed to refresh their 
    insight and adjust their propensities to this new reality. Indeed, even the primary gathering of advanced 
    locals separates the people who were brought into the world without the web that we know today 
    (twenty- to thirty-year-old or age Y) and the individuals
     who were brought into the world with the current organization of organizations (web age or age).<br><br>
 
 The schooling area is no more bizarre to this ICT upheaval,
  being today an area where computerized change is a relentless occasion. Thus, educators frequently carry out new ICT- based systems in the home room to catch the consideration of the understudies and inspire them to concentrate on various subjects, paying little mind to instructive level. In this sense, functional classes generally created in labs (e.g., in which trials are completed) are moving to virtual universes.<br><br>
  
 Basic components of engineering are critical thinking, planning, 
 making and building. In this manner, to plan understudies for a profession in engineering, hypothetical information and functional encounters are an unquestionable requirement for their schooling. Hypothetical learning is predominantly conveyed through talks and instructional exercises, while functional encounters are regularly conveyed through involved research center meetings. Research center preparation is totally fundamental in designing and in most science-related disciplines. It assists understudies with understanding and supporting their hypothetical ideas, and furthermore focuses on a
  scope of learning results, including experiential learning processes that can't be conveyed through talks and instructional exercises. Research facility preparing has been an obligatory educational plan prerequisite for scholastic license by numerous experts designing bodies.<br><br>
 
 There is a consensus on the importance of laboratory work in engineering education. 
 Laboratory sessions are central to engineering education, which is an important difference 
 that sets an engineering degree apart. Working in the lab is the first hands-on training experience an 
 engineering student experiences in his career. An important part of the curriculum, the lab assists
  students in a practical learning process and gives them confidence in their knowledge and skills.<br><br>
 
 In this regard, electrical/electronic engineering research has traditionally been 
 associated with the use of traditional classroom laboratories. A student is considered fit for industry only when he/she has gained some kind of practical experience or training in the learning and gaining the degree's phase. The degree is of no importance if there is no practical knowledge and understanding gained.
 
 Everything was going smoothly until the world got hit by the global pandemic and the 
 pandemic more or less changed the dynamics of an engineering degree to a great extent. 
 The institutions, professors, and the students were in a dilemma of how to communicate,
  exchanging knowledge through online mode was hap hazardous. After a lot of thinking, hard work,
   and a stable amount of communication, the institutions started with online teaching, which no doubt
    was a lot more difficult than it seemed when everything started functioning smoothly in the online mode.<br><br>
 
 Some disadvantages of Virtual/Online Labs are:<br>
 1.	One of the adverse consequences of Virtual Labs is that it diminishes the immediate connection among understudies and one another, and among understudies and educators, considering that the correspondence between them is often electronically.</br>
 2.	Because of the investigation in the virtual lab, the understudy can rehash however many times as needed, the understudy will get uncaring toward disappointment and risk in a genuine circumstance.</br>
 3.	understudies can gain something helpful from full tactile involvement with a genuine lab like abnormal commotion and smell, irregular mistake, defective apparatus, and so forth which is beyond the realm of possibilities in internet-based mode.</br>
  
 4.	The teachers and lab assistants have to be present beforehand and record the lab experiments or livestream the ongoings of the laboratory. When the recorded video is shared on screen, the network or low bandwidth issue hinders the learning of the students and acts as a barrier.<br><br>
 
 The science learning objectives of research facility encounters incorporate upgrading authority of science topics, creating logical thinking capacities, expanding comprehension of the intricacy and uncertainty of exact work, creating reasonable abilities, expanding comprehension of the idea of science, developing interest in science and science learning, and further developing cooperation capacities.<br><br>
<!--  
 The explorers propose that lab encounters will be bound to accomplish these objectives if:<br>
 1.	They are planned considering clear learning results.<br>
 2.	They are nicely sequenced into the progression of study hall science guidance.<br>
 3.	They incorporate learning of science content and interaction.<br>
 4.	They fuse continuous understudy reflection and conversation.<br> -->
 
 
 We have seen and faced a lot of disadvantages of online/virtual laboratories and definitely offline labs still have and will always have an edge over the virtual labs. Keeping all the criteria and problems faced by the teachers and students in mind, we have decided to make a laboratory kit that will give a full-time hands-on experience to its users. The lab kit will not only give online experience of virtual labs but will also comprise of the hardware component that will allow the user to observe live changes and results of the experiment rather than just watching it online.
 
 The lab tool kit will consist of different components required in the different experiments. The software will also have the lab manuals of different experiments. There will also be a hardware kit that will consist of the basic electronic components, Raspberry pi, Arduino, servo motor etc.
 
 The goal of the project is to reach out to a lot of college students or the ones simply willing to learn or students who want to do a crash course of the subject.

          <h1>What is Control System?</h1>
          <!-- <p>
            A control system is a set of mechanical or electronic devices that regulates other devices or systems by way of control loops. 
            Typically, control systems are computerized. Control systems are a central part of industry and of automation.
         </p> -->

        <div class="row">
          <!-- <div class="col-lg-4">
            <img src="assets/img/about.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
          </div> -->
          <!-- <div class="col-lg-8 pt-4 pt-lg-0 content"> -->
            <!-- <h3> &amp; </h3> -->
            <!-- <p class="fst-italic"><p> --><p>
              There are two main types of control loops: Open loops, which operate with human input, and closed loops, which are fully autonomous. Some loops can be switched between closed and open modes. When open, a switchable loop is manually controlled and when closed it is fully automated.

              Programmable logic controllers (PLCs), programmable automation controllers (PACs), remote terminal units (RTUs), 
              control servers, intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and sensors are some of the elements of control loops that are in turn a part of control systems. The control loops that make up control systems are generally made themselves of a sensor, a controller and a final control element. The sensor reads the process variable or a related measurement. The controller receives the signal from the sensor and then forwards it to instrumentation, to remote terminal units and to final control elements where the process variable is adjusted, 
              to be kept constant at what is known as a set point.<br><br>
              In recent years, control systems have played a central role in the development and advancement of modern technology and civilization. Practically every aspect of our day-to-day life is affected more or less by some type of control system.

Examples of control systems in your day-to-day life include an air conditioner, a refrigerator, an air conditioner, a bathroom toilet tank, an automatic iron, and many processes within a car – such as cruise control.
         <h2>Features of a Control System</h2><br>
The main feature of a control system is that there should be a clear mathematical relationship between the input and output of the system.

When the relation between input and output of the system can be represented by a linear proportionality, the system is called a linear control system.

Again when the relationship between input and output cannot be represented by single linear proportionality, rather the input and output are related by some non-linear relation, the system is referred to as a non-linear control system.<br><br>
<h2>Requirements of a Good Control System</h2><br>

Accuracy: Accuracy is the measurement tolerance of the instrument and defines the limits of the errors made when the instrument is used in normal operating conditions.

Accuracy can be improved by using feedback elements. To increase the accuracy of any control system error detector should be present in the control system.<br>

Sensitivity: The parameters of a control system are always changing with the change in surrounding conditions, internal disturbance, or any other parameters.

This change can be expressed in terms of sensitivity. Any control system should be insensitive to such parameters but sensitive to input signals only.<br>
Noise: An undesired input signal is known as noise. A good control system should be able to reduce the noise effect for better performance.<br>

Stability: It is an important characteristic of the control system. For the bounded input signal, the output must be bounded and if the input is zero then the output must be zero then such a control system is said to be a stable system.<br>

Bandwidth: An operating frequency range decides the bandwidth of the control system. Bandwidth should be as large as possible for the frequency response of a good control system.<br>

Speed: It is the time taken by the control system to achieve its stable output. A good control system possesses high speed. The transient period for such a system is very small.<br>

Oscillation: A small number of oscillations or constant oscillations of output tends to indicate the system to be stable.<br>
